# README

Keeper is a Cryptocurrency status tool using the [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com) API.

## Requirements:

* Go 1.9.2 or higher

## Installation:

`go get -u github.com/kyoto-shift/keeper`

## Use:

`-h, --help` Basically displays this.  
`-v, --version` Prints the current version of Keeper.  
`-c, --currency` Changes the tracked Cryptocurrency. If set to `all`, Keeper will track the top 10 (unless changed by `-a`) Cryptocurrencies (according to CoinMarketCap).  
`-a --amount` Sets the number of currencies `-c all` will track. If `-c all` isn't used, this will have no effect.

[user@computer]$ keeper -c bitcoin

# CHANGELOG

**0.2.0**  
* Added `-i, --interval` flag which changes the tracker's update time.
* Added `-a, --amount` flag which changes the number of top currencies tracked.
* Added rank of currencies if multiple are being tracked.
* Changed `top` to `all` if `-c` is used.
* Changed default value of `all` from 50 to 10. It can now also be changed with `-a [number]`
* Fixed version flag being unuseable unless `-c [crypto]` was used first.

**0.1.2**  
* Initial release.
